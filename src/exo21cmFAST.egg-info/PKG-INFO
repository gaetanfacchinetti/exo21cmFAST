# exo21cmFAST

**A semi-numerical cosmological simulation code for the radio 21-cm signal including non cold dark matter scenarios.**

In this code we introduce several features to [**21cmFAST**](https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmFAST)[^1][^2] related to non cold dark matter effects on the matter power spectrum and on structure formation.

In the future, this code should be merged with the main branch of **21cmFAST**.

## Installing the ncdm branch of exo21cmFAST

To install this version of **exo21cmFAST**, download that branch with
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/exo21cmFAST.git --branch ncdm --single-branch
```
On your terminal then go to the main folder (containing the file `config.py`) and run

```bash
$ pip install [-e] .
```


## The physics behind exo21cmFAST ncdm

The physics behind exotic energy injection and notations and introduced in this section.

### Matter power spectrum and transfer function

### Non linear effects on structure collapse

### Effective parametrisation
 

## What is new/different in exo21cmFAST?

The new features are implemented in the `run_lightcone` function which accepts several new arguments. In addition, we provide new input parameters in the `astro_params` and `flag_options` arguments related to the exotic energy injection and its treatment. All new inputs are listed below (for more information go to [`src/inputs.py`](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/exo21cmFAST/blob/master/src/py21cmfast/inputs.py) and [`src/wrapper.py`](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/exo21cmFAST/blob/master/src/py21cmfast/wrapper.py)).

### 1. Astro parameters
*These parameters are the *astrophysical* quantities which can be included in an inference analysis (a MCMC with [**21cmMC**](https://github.com/21cmfast/21CMMC) or a Fisher forecast with [**21cmCAST**](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/21cmCAST))*

The numerical parameters related to the dark matter properties (the only necessary ones when using **DarkHistory**)
 - `DM_LOG10_MASS`: $\log_{10}(m_\chi / {\rm eV})$  mass of the dark matter particle
 - `DM_LOG10_SIGMAV`:  $\log_{10}(\left<\sigma v\right> /{\rm cm^3 / s^{-1}})$ annihilation cross section
 - `DM_LOG10_LIFETIME`: $\log_{10}(\tau / {\rm s})$ lifetime of decaying dark matter
 - (`DM_DECAY_RATE`: $\Gamma/{\rm s^{-1}} = {\rm s} / \tau$ decay rate of decaying dark matter). Need `DM_USE_DECAY_RATE` set to `True` in the Flag options to be used (otherwise the value of `DM_LOG10_LIFETIME` is used)

The numerical parameters related to the effective parametrisation

 - `DM_FHEAT_APPROX_PARAM_LOG10_F0`: $\log_{10}(f_0)$
 - `DM_FHEAT_APPROX_PARAM_A`: $a$
 - `DM_FHEAT_APPROX_PARAM_B`: $b$
 - `DM_LOG10_FION_H_OVER_FHEAT`: $\log_{10}(c_1) = \log_{10}(f_{\rm ion., HII} / f_{\rm heat})$
 - `DM_LOG10_FION_HE_OVER_FHEAT`: $\log_{10}(c_2) = \log_{10}(f_{\rm ion., HeII} / f_{\rm heat})$
 - `DM_LOG10_FEXC_OVER_FHEAT`:  $\log_{10}(c_3) = \log_{10}(f_{\rm exc.} / f_{\rm heat})$
 - `LOG10_TK_at_Z_HEAT_MAX$`: $T_{\rm k}(z_{\rm init})$ initial condition for the temperature
 - `LOG10_XION_at_Z_HEAT_MAX$`: $x_{\rm e}(z_{\rm init})$ initial condition for the electron fraction

### 2. Flag options

General flags
- `USE_DM_ENERGY_INJECTION`: *boolean* if `True` turns on exotic energy injection

Flags related to **DarkHistory**:
- `DM_PROCESS`: *string* $\in$ ['swave', 'decay', 'none'] specify the type of enerjy injection
- `DM_PRIMARY`: *string* $\in$ ['elec_delta', 'e', 'phot_delta', 'gamma', 'mu', ...] (see **DarkHistory** documentation for all the possibillities) primary particles in which dark matter decays or annihilates
- `DM_BOOST`: *string* $\in$ ['erfc', 'einasto_subs', 'einasto_no_subs', 'NFW_subs', 'NFW_no_subs'] preimplemented boost function $\mathcal{B}(z)$ for dark matter annihilation
- `DM_FS_METHOD`: *string* $\in$ ['He', 'no_He', 'He_recomb'] method to compute the deposition fractions (see **DarkHistory** documentation for more details)
- `DM_BACKREACTION`: *boolean* if `True` turns on exotic energy injection
- `DM_USE_DECAY_RATE`: *boolean* if `True` uses `DM_DECAY_RATE` instead of `DM_LOG10_LIFETIME` to evaluate the energy injection from dark matter decay
  
Flags related to the effective parametrisation:
- `USE_DM_EFFECTIVE_DEP_FUNCS`: *boolean* if `True` bypasses **DarkHistory** and uses the effective parametrisation for the deposition functions
- `DM_FHEAT_APPROX_SHAPE`: *integer* or *string* $\in$ [0: 'none', 1: 'constant', 2: 'exponential', 3: 'schechter'] functional form of the deposition fraction into heat $F(z)$
- `USE_DM_CUSTOM_F_RATIOS`: *boolean* if `True` uses `DM_LOG10_FION_H_OVER_FHEAT`, `DM_LOG10_FION_HE_OVER_FHEAT`, `DM_LOG10_FION_HE_OVER_FHEAT` to relate the other deposition fractions to $f_{\rm heat}$. If `False` uses predefined values obtained from scans of **DarkHistory** results
- `USE_CUSTOM_INIT_COND`: *boolean* forces initial conditions to `LOG10_TK_at_Z_HEAT_MAX` and `LOG10_XION_at_Z_HEAT_MAX`. If `USE_CUSTOM_INIT_COND` is `False` and `FORCE_DEFAULT_INIT_COND` is `False` the initial conditions are set either by vanilla RECFAST if `USE_DM_EFFECTIVE_DEP_FUNCS` is `False` or by the result of the **DarkHistory** run otherwise. Cannot be set to `True` if `FORCE_DEFAULT_INIT_COND` is `True` as well
- `FORCE_DEFAULT_INIT_COND`: *boolean*  forces the initial conditions to be that of vanilla RECFAST (even if exotic energy injection has happened before redshift $z_{\rm init}=$ `Z_HEAT_MAX`). If `USE_CUSTOM_INIT_COND` is `False` and `FORCE_DEFAULT_INIT_COND` is `False` the initial conditions are set either by vanilla RECFAST if `USE_DM_EFFECTIVE_DEP_FUNCS` is `False` or by the result of the **DarkHistory** run otherwise. Cannot be set to True if `USE_CUSTOM_INIT_COND` is `True` as well.


### 3. run_lightcone arguments

- `coarsen_factor`: *integer* redifines the redshift steps to match with the table of **DarkHistory**. Note that if we use energy deposition through the templates this value can be arbitrary. Be default it is set to 16 to match with the nominal redshift step definition of 21cmFAST.
- `verbose_ntbk`: *boolean* if `True` outputs more information during the run, which can be useful when running 21cmFAST on small boxed in a notebook.
- `output_exotic_data`: *boolean* if `True` gives a second output to the `run_lightcone()` function in the form of a dictionnary. This dictionnary contains the deposition fractions `'f'`, electron fraction `'x'`, gaz temperature `'Tm'` at every redshifts in `'z'`.
- `heating_rate_output`: *string* defines a file where to save the the heating rate due to exotic energy injection and astrophycial energy injection. If nothing specified, the heating rates are not saved.

## Using exo21cmFAST

Some examples are provided in `exo21cmFAST/examples` and play the role of small tutorials. In particular see [`example_notebook.py`](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/exo21cmFAST/blob/master/examples/example_notebook.ipynb). 

The most simple code that can be run for a test assuming dark matter decyaing into $e^+e^-$ with a mass of 100 MeV, a lifetime $\tau = 10^{26}$ s, and using **DarkHistory** is

```python
import py21cmfast as p21f

lightcone = p21f.run_lightcone(
        redshift = 5,
        user_params = {"BOX_LEN": 250, "HII_DIM": 128},
        astro_params = {"DM_LOG10_MASS": 8.0, "DM_LOG10_LIFETIME": 26.0},
        flag_options = {
            "USE_DM_ENERGY_INJECTION" : True,
            "USE_TS_FLUCT"            : True, 
            "DM_PROCESS"              : 'decay',
            "DM_PRIMARY"              : 'elec_delta'    
        },
        direc='./cache', 
    )

lightcone.save(fname = "my_ligthcone.h5")
```

A more complete example is also provided in [`example_run.py`](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/exo21cmFAST/blob/master/examples/example_run.py).

Once the lightcone is created, it can be analysed with different tools. See [**21cmCAST** documentation](https://github.com/gaetanfacchinetti/21cmCAST) for an example.

Changelog
=========

dev-version
-----------

Fixed
~~~~~

* Incorrect sign on adiabatic fluctuations.

v3.3.1 [24 May 2023]
----------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

* Compilation of C code for some compilers (#330)

v3.3.0 [17 May 2023]
----------------------

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

* Refactored setting up of inputs to high-level functions so that there is less code
  repetition.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Running with ``R_BUBBLE_MAX`` too large auto-fixes it to be ``BOX_LEN`` (#112)
* Bug in calling ``clear_cache``.
* Inconsistency in the way that the very highest redshift of an evolution is handled
  between low-level code (eg. ``spin_temperature()``) and high-level code (eg. ``run_coeval()``).


Added
~~~~~

* New ``validate_all_inputs`` function that cross-references the four main input structs
  and ensures all the parameters make sense together. Mostly for internal use.
* Ability to save/read directly from an open HDF5 File (#170)
* An implementation of cloud-in-cell to more accurately redistribute the perturbed mass
  across all neighbouring cells instead of the previous nearest cell approach
* Changed PhotonConsEndCalibz from z = 5 -> z = 3.5 to handle later reionisation
  scenarios in line with current observations (#305)
* Add in an initialisation check for the photon conservation to address some issues
  arising for early EOR histories (#311)
* Added ``NON_CUBIC_FACTOR`` to ``UserParams`` to allow for non-cubic coeval boxes (#289)

v3.2.1 [13 Sep 2022]
----------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Included log10_mturnovers(_mini) in lightcone class. Only useful when USE_MINI_HALOS


v3.2.0 [11 Jul 2022]
----------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Floats are now represented to a specific number of significant digits in the hash of
  an output object. This fixes problems with very close redshifts not being read from
  cache (#80). Note that this means that very close astro/cosmo params will now be read
  from cache. This could cause issues when creating large databases with many random
  parameters. The behaviour can modified in the configuration by setting the
  ``cache_param_sigfigs`` and ``cache_redshift_sigfigs`` parameters (these are 6 and
  4 by default, respectively).
  **NOTE**: updating to this version will cause your previous cached files to become
  unusable. Remove them before updating.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Added a missing C-based error to the known errors in Python.

v3.1.5 [27 Apr 2022]
----------------------

v3.1.4 [10 Feb 2022]
----------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

* error in FFT normalization in FindHaloes
* docs not compiling on RTD due to missing ``scipy.integrate`` mock module
* Updated matplotlib removed support for setting vmin/vmax and norm. Now passes vmin/vmax
  to the norm() constructor.

v3.1.3 [27 Oct 2021]
----------------------

* Fixed ``FAST_FCOLL_TABLES`` so it only affects MCGs and not ACGs. Added tests of this
  flag for high and low z separately.

v3.1.2 [14 Jul 2021]
----------------------

Internals
~~~~~~~~~
* ``MINIMIZE_MEMORY`` flag significantly reduces memory without affecting performance much,
  by changing the way some arrays are allocated and accessed in C. (#224)

Change
~~~~~~

* Updated ``USE_INTERPOLATION_TABLES`` to be default True. This makes much more sense as
  a default value. Until v4, a warning will be raised if it is not set explicitly.


v3.1.1 [13 Jun 2021]
----------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

* Bug in deployment to PyPI.

v3.1.0 [13 Jun 2021]
----------------------

Added
~~~~~
* Ability to access all evolutionary Coeval components, either from the end Coeval
  class, or the Lightcone.
* Ability to gather all evolutionary antecedents from a Coeval/Lightcone into the one
  file.
* ``FAST_FCOLL_TABLES`` in ``UserParams`` which improves speeds quite significantly for
  ~<10% accuracy decrease.
* Fast and low-memory generation of relative-velocity (vcb) initial conditions. Eliminated hi-res vcb boxes, as they are never needed.
* Also output the mean free path (i.e. MFP_box in IonizedBox).
* Added the effect of DM-baryon relative velocities on PopIII-forming minihaloes. This now provides the correct background evolution jointly with LW feedback. It gives rise to velocity-induced acoustic oscillations (VAOs) from the relative-velocity fluctuations. We also follow a more flexible parametrization for LW feedback in minihaloes, following new simulation results, and add a new index ALPHA_STAR_MINI for minihaloes, now independent of regular ACGs.
* New ``hooks`` keyword to high-level functions, that are run on the completion of each computational step, and can
  be used to more generically write parts of the data to file.
* Ability to pass a function to ``write=`` to write more specific aspects of the data (internally, this will be put into the ``hooks`` dictionary).
* ``run_lightcone`` and ``run_coeval`` use significantly less memory by offloading initial conditions and perturb_field instances to disk if possible.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Bug in 2LPT when ``USE_RELATIVE_VELOCITIES=True`` [Issue #191, PR #192]
* Error raised when redshifts are not in ascending order [Issue #176, PR #177]
* Errors when ``USE_FFTW_WISDOM`` is used on some systems [Issue #174, PR #199]
* Bug in ComputeIonizedBox causing negative recombination rate and ring structure in ``Gamma12_box`` [Issue #194, PR #210]
* Error in determining the wisdom file name [Issue #209, PR#210]
* Bug in which cached C-based memory would be read in and free'd twice.

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

* Added ``dft.c``, which makes doing all the cubic FFTs a lot easier and more consistent. [PR #199]
* More generic way of keeping track of arrays to be passed between C and Python, and their shape in Python, using ``_get_box_structures``.
  This also means that the various boxes can be queried before they are initialized and computed.
* More stringent integration tests that test each array, not just the final brightness temperature.
* Ability to plot the integration test data to more easily identify where things have gone wrong (use ``--plots`` in the ``pytest`` invocation).
* Nicer CLI interface for ``produce_integration_test_data.py``. New options to ``clean`` the ``test_data/`` directory,
  and also test data is saved by user-defined key rather than massive string of variables.
* Nicer debug statements before calls to C, for easily comparing between versions.
* Much nicer methods of keeping track of array state (in memory, on disk, c-controlled, etc.)
* Ability to free C-based pointers in a more granular way.

v3.0.3
------

Added
~~~~~
* ``coeval_callback`` and ``coeval_callback_redshifts`` flags to the ``run_lightcone``.
  Gives the ability to run arbitrary code on ``Coeval`` boxes.
* JOSS paper!
* ``get_fields`` classmethod on all output classes, so that one can easily figure out
  what fields are computed (and available) for that class.

Fixed
~~~~~
* Only raise error on non-available ``external_table_path`` when actually going to use it.

v3.0.2
------

Fixed
-----
* Added prototype functions to enable compilation for some standard compilers on MacOS.

v3.0.1
------
Modifications to the internal code structure of 21cmFAST

Added
~~~~~
* Refactor FFTW wisdom creation to be a python callable function


v3.0.0
------
Complete overhaul of 21cmFAST, including a robust python-wrapper and interface,
caching mechanisms, and public repository with continuous integration. Changes
and equations for minihalo features in this version are found in
https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04442

All functionality of the original 21cmFAST v2 C-code has been implemented in this
version, including ``USE_HALO_FIELD`` and performing full integration instead of using
the interpolation tables (which are faster).

Added
~~~~~
* Updated the radiation source model: (i) all radiation fields including X-rays, UV
  ionizing, Lyman Werner and Lyman alpha are considered from two seperated population
  namely atomic-cooling (ACGs) and minihalo-hosted molecular-cooling galaxies (MCGs);
  (ii) the turn-over masses of ACGs and MCGs are estimated with cooling efficiency and
  feedback from reionization and lyman werner suppression (Qin et al. 2020). This can
  be switched on using new ``flag_options`` ``USE_MINI_HALOS``.
* Updated kinetic temperature of the IGM with fully ionized cells following equation 6
  of McQuinn (2015) and partially ionized cells having the volume-weightied temperature
  between the ionized (volume: 1-xHI; temperature T_RE ) and neutral components (volume:
  xHI; temperature: temperature of HI). This is stored in IonizedBox as
  temp_kinetic_all_gas. Note that Tk in TsBox remains to be the kinetic temperature of HI.
* Tests: many unit tests, and also some regression tests.
* CLI: run 21cmFAST boxes from the command line, query the cache database, and produce
  plots for standard comparison runs.
* Documentation: Jupyter notebook demos and tutorials, FAQs, installation instructions.
* Plotting routines: a number of general plotting routines designed to plot coeval
  and lightcone slices.
* New power spectrum option (``POWER_SPECTRUM=5``) that uses a CLASS-based transfer
  function. WARNING: If POWER_SPECTRUM==5 the cosmo parameters cannot be altered, they
  are set to the Planck2018 best-fit values for now (until CLASS is added):
  (omegab=0.02237, omegac= 0.120, hubble=0.6736 (the rest are irrelevant for the
  transfer functions, but in case:  A_s=2.100e-9, n_s=0.9649, z_reio = 11.357)
* New ``user_params`` option ``USE_RELATIVE_VELOCITIES``, which produces initial relative
  velocity cubes (option implemented, but not the actual computation yet).
* Configuration management.
* global params now has a context manager for changing parameters temporarily.
* Vastly improved error handling: exceptions can be caught in C code and propagated to
  Python to inform the user of what's going wrong.
* Ability to write high-level data (``Coeval`` and ``Lightcone`` objects) directly to
  file in a simple portable format.

Changed
~~~~~~~
* ``POWER_SPECTRUM`` option moved from ``global_params`` to ``user_params``.
* Default cosmology updated to Planck18.

v2.0.0
------
All changes and equations for this version are found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08995.

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Updated the ionizing source model: (i) the star formation rates and ionizing escape
  fraction are scaled with the masses of dark matter halos and (ii) the abundance of
  active star forming galaxies is exponentially suppressed below the turn-over halo
  mass, M_{turn}, according to a duty cycle of exp(−M_{turn}/M_{h}), where M_{h} is a
  halo mass.
* Removed the mean free path parameter, R_{mfp}. Instead, directly computes
  inhomogeneous, sub-grid recombinations in the intergalactic medium following the
  approach of Sobacchi & Mesinger (2014)




v1.2.0
------
Added
~~~~~
* Support for a halo mass dependent ionizing efficiency: zeta = zeta_0 (M/Mmin)^alpha,
  where zeta_0 corresponds to  HII_EFF_FACTOR, Mmin --> ION_M_MIN,
  alpha --> EFF_FACTOR_PL_INDEX in ANAL_PARAMS.H


v1.12.0
-------
Added
~~~~~
- Code 'redshift_interpolate_boxes.c' to interpolate between comoving cubes,
  creating comoving light cone boxes.
- Enabled openMP threading  for SMP machines.  You can specify the number of threads
  (for best performace, do not exceed the number of processors) in INIT_PARAMS.H. You do
  not need to have an SMP machine to run the code. NOTE: YOU SHOULD RE-INSTALL FFTW to
  use openMP (see INSTALL file)
- Included a threaded driver file 'drive_zscroll_reion_param.c' set-up to perform
  astrophysical parameter studies of reionization
- Included explicit support for WDM cosmologies; see COSMOLOGY.H.  The prescription is
  similar to that discussed in Barkana+2001; Mesinger+2005, madifying the (i) transfer
  function (according to the Bode+2001 formula; and (ii) including the effective
  pressure term of WDM using a Jeans mass analogy.  (ii) is approximated with a sharp
  cuttoff in the EPS barrier, using 60* M_J found in Barkana+2001 (the 60 is an
  adjustment factor found by fitting to the WDM collapsed fraction).
- A Gaussian filtering step of the PT fields to perturb_field.c, in addition to the
  implicit boxcar smoothing.  This avoids having"empty" density cells, i.e. \delta=-1,
  with some small loss in resolution.  Although for most uses \delta=-1 is ok, some Lya
  forest statistics do not like it.
- Added treatment of the risidual electron fraction from X-ray heating when computing
  the ionization field.  Relatedly, modified Ts.c to output all intermediate evolution
  boxes, Tk and x_e.
- Added a missing factor of Omega_b in Ts.c corresponding to eq. 18 in MFC11.  Users who
  used a previous version should note that their results just effecively correspond to a
  higher effective X-ray efficiency, scaled by 1/Omega_baryon.
- Normalization optimization to Ts.c, increasing performace on arge resolution boxes


Fixed
~~~~~
- GSL interpolation error in kappa_elec_pH for GSL versions > 1.15
- Typo in macro definition, which impacted the Lya background calculation in v1.11 (not applicable to earlier releases)
- Outdated filename sytax when calling gen_size_distr in drive_xHIscroll
- Redshift scrolling so that drive_logZscroll_Ts.c and Ts.c are in sync.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Output format to avoid FFT padding for all boxes
- Filename conventions to be more explicit.
- Small changes to organization and structure


v1.1.0
------
Added
~~~~~
- Wrapper functions mod_fwrite() and mod_fread() in Cosmo_c_progs/misc.c, which
  should fix problems with the library fwrite() and fread() for large files (>4GB) on
  certain operating systems.
- Included print_power_spectrum_ICs.c program which reads in high resolution initial
  conditions and prints out an ASCII file with the associated power spectrum.
- Parameter in Ts.c for the maximum allowed kinetic temperature, which increases
  stability of the code when the redshift step size and the X-ray efficiencies are large.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Oversight adding support for a Gaussian filter for the lower resolution field.
